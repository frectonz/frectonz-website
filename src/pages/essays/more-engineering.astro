        I think the world needs more engineering—not just in the realm of
        natural sciences, but also in the social sciences. In this context, I’m
        using the word engineering to describe the process of understanding a
        preexisting system or natural occurrence, and then building additional
        systems on top of it to help humans influence or control that thing. I
        know that definition is overly broad and generic, but don’t worry—it’ll
        be useful.
      </p>

      <p>I think, generally, there are two types of knowledge.</p>

      <p>
        The first is knowledge for the sake of knowledge—just knowing that
        something exists or doesn’t exist, or understanding how something works.
        This kind of knowledge helps us answer questions and satisfy our
        curiosity. Like knowing why the sky is blue, or why the sun always rises
        in the east. It helps us understand our environment, how things came to
        be the way they are, and so on. This kind of knowledge is tremendously
        useful because it helps us map the domains of our existence. This is
        what I think science does.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second type is knowledge for tools—knowledge that helps us create
        things that take us from merely understanding our existence to actually
        controlling it. This type of knowledge is built on top of the first
        kind. Obviously, you need some understanding of a thing before you can
        begin developing tools to manipulate it. This is what I think
        engineering is.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, in brief: we use science to understand systems, and we use
        engineering to control them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here’s an example: we use knowledge from astronomy to understand why
        seasons exist and why winter happens. That’s the understanding part. But
        that knowledge alone isn’t very helpful to someone who’s dying of
        hypothermia. So, we combine our understanding of astronomy,
        thermodynamics, and electronics to create a tool—an air conditioner or
        heater—that lets us regulate indoor temperatures regardless of the whims
        of the planet. We can go even further and build gas pipelines to heat
        every home in an entire country.
      </p>

      <p>
        These two kinds of knowledge don’t oppose each other—they build on each
        other. Engineering uses what we’ve learned from science to create new
        and better tools. And those tools, in turn, help us gain new scientific
        insights. I’m not saying one is better than the other; both are
        important. The key difference is that one diagnoses, and the other
        prescribes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Science itself is also split into two broad domains. One seeks to
        understand the natural world—what exists independent of human influence.
        The other tries to understand the systems we’ve built for ourselves: our
        societies, institutions, and the behaviors that emerge from human
        interaction. Of course, not all social systems are intentionally
        designed—many are emergent properties of large numbers of people
        interacting. The first domain is what we call natural science, and the
        second is social science.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main point I want to make is that natural science has embraced tools
        and engineering from the very beginning. It grew alongside them. But
        social science, in contrast, often seems willfully ignorant of—or even
        fearful toward—engineering. It seems nearly incapable of prescribing
        solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        To me, it feels like as we make progress in natural science and its
        associated engineering, we’re hitting bottlenecks caused by the lack of
        engineering tools coming out of social science. That’s why I’m saying:
        we need more engineering. We need more social engineering—not in the
        pejorative or manipulative sense, but in the practical, systems-building
        sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are some good reasons why we don’t see much engineering coming out
        of social sciences.
      </p>

      <p>
        One is the potential for fallout from a failed or misused tool. The
        consequences can be severe. Economic policy is a good example of a tool
        born from social science engineering. Implementing such a policy in a
        given region makes the policymakers directly responsible for any poverty
        or suffering it might cause. We often see this with demographic
        policies, too. Because of this, many experts in social sciences are wary
        of making prescriptive, engineering-style moves—there are just too many
        examples of them going wrong.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another challenge is that social engineering often requires holistic
        application to be effective. That means everyone in a given area has to
        adopt it for it to work. These changes can’t usually be applied
        incrementally, so they require a lot of power and effort to execute. And
        often, the people with the power to make such changes aren’t the same as
        those who’ve designed the new tools or systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        That said, I don’t think these problems will continue to prevent us from
        developing useful tools in the social sciences. I just wish more social
        science experts focused on controlling, not just understanding. I wish
        more of them had an engineering mindset.
